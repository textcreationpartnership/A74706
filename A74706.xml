            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

That there is a free and uninterupted paſſage of the Goſpel running through the midſt of us, and Liberty for all to hold forth and profeſs with ſobriety, their light and knowledge therin, according as the Lord in his rich Grace and wiſdom has diſpenſed to every man, and with the ſame freedom to practice and exerciſe the Faith of the Goſpel, and to lead quiet and peaceable Lives in all Godlineſs and Honeſty, without any interuption from the Powers God has ſet over this Commonwealth, nay with all juſt and due encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereto, &amp; protection in ſo doing by the ſame; a mercy that is the Price of much blood, and till of late years denied to this Nation, as at this day it continues to be to moſt of the Nations round about us, and which all that fear <hi>God</hi> among us ought duly to conſider and be thankfull for in this Day, wherein God has ſo graciouſly viſited and redeemed his people; His Highneſs, as he reckons it a Duty incumbent upon him, and ſhall take all poſſible care to preſerve &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue this freedom and liberty to all perſons in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth fearing God though of differing Judgments, by protecting them in the ſober &amp; quiet exerciſe and profeſſion of Religion, and the ſincere worſhip of God, againſt all ſuch who ſhall, by impoſing upon the Conſciences of their Brethren, or offering violence to their perſons, or any other way ſeek to hinder them therein; So likewiſe doth hee hold himſelf equally obliged to take care, That on no pretence whatſoever, ſuch freedom given ſhould be extended by any beyond thoſe bounds which the Royall Law of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian moderation</hi> have ſet us in our walking one toward another; or that thereby occaſion ſhould be taken by any

From thence, it is ſaid, the Court intends to remove to <hi>Lyon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here has been a duell this week between 6 of the Pages of the Kings great Stable, three againſt three, wherein 3. were ſlaine, and the other 3 eſcaped; which being Known to the King, he is highly incenſed at it.</p>
                  <p>The Marquis of <hi>Caſtelnau</hi> and of <hi>Mompouillan,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the French Cavalrie, are now in a good poſture, and intend to march abroad and brave the enemies, &amp; put releef into Queſnoy, with theſe 10.

                  <p>Here is much talk, as if the Peace were concluded betwixt France and England. The K. intends to appear in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in his Army in Picardy. Here is news come that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Lyonne,</hi> Ambaſſador for his Majeſty in Rome, did boldly declare to the Cardinals, before they entred into the Conclave; That in caſe they ſhall chuſe a Pope that is affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to Spain, and of that faction, then the King his maſter did not doubt but he ſhould uſe ſome means or other to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to reaſon.

Its certi fied by letters from the Hague in Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that the Spaniards make great preparations, by making their levies in Germany; &amp; that 900000 livres are brought

                     <hi>From Paris February</hi> 26. farther, That the great worthy of France, the Du. of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> came Poſt into <hi>Paris</hi> on Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day laſt, laden with Italian Trophies, and French ribbands. They relate likewiſe the great anxiety of the Cardinall, in behalf of his Niece, wife to the Prince of Conti, who dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing at Montpelier, in the time of the Carnevall, got a ſlip and hurt her ſelf; but the Letters ſay, he needs not bee ſo much troubled, becauſe he can never want Nieces to furniſh the Princes of the Blood of France, ſo long as Italy can afford him handſome young Women to train up for the purpoſe.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>Upon my late return from the view of the ruefull Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations which the War and Peſtilence hath made in divers parts of Ireland, I finde here is an erection of new Judges, to determine Eſtates and qualifications of Iriſh, tranſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; Mr <hi>Santhy</hi> the only pretender to Law, the reſt are Mr <hi>John Gay,</hi> Mr <hi>Robert Doyley,</hi> Mr <hi>Thomas Hooke,</hi> Mr <hi>Iſaac Dobſon,</hi> and Mr <hi>William Franckland;</hi> The Courts of Juſtice would be ſetled, were the Publique Scale come over, and Judges named in England. In the mean time, for preſent, the former adminiſtration is continued.</p>
                  <p>The company of Foot that mutinyed when they were to be ſhipped and tranſported for England (which by the way take notice of, how well the Engliſh like this Country, when once uſed to, and ſetled in it) were caſhiered in the Market place. All things are working on here towards a ſettlement.</p>

                  <head>From <hi>Rome, January</hi> 25.</head>
                  <p>On the 17 inſtant, were celebrated the Funerals of the deceaſed Pope, <hi>Innocent</hi> the Tenth; and a Funeral Oration was made by the Count <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>baldini,</hi> Secretary to the Conſiſtory.</p>
                  <p>Upon the 19, the Cardinals were ſhut up cloſe, after the accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed manner, and immediatly the leading Cardinals of every Faction began to labor hard about the Election of a Pope, every one ſtriving
<pb n="5146" facs="tcp:168799:4"/> to make a holy Father that ſhall be at their own devotion. It is publickly known already, that the Cardinal <hi>Caraſſa</hi> hath had 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Cardinal <hi>Sacchetti</hi> 22, Cardinal <hi>Ghiguy</hi> 27. and Cardinal <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi> 36. But that ſtatue called <hi>Paſquin,</hi> (upon which the wits of <hi>Rome</hi> uſe to faſten their Libels called Paſquins or Paſquils) hath declared, that <hi>Fioranzola,</hi> or elſe <hi>Carpegno</hi> (two of the weakeſt Cardinals) to be Pope.</p>
                  <p>At another time, the learned <hi>Paſquin</hi> would have had Cardinal <hi>Cechini,</hi> or elſe <hi>Rappocioli</hi> to be choſen.</p>
                  <p>Of 69 Cardinals now living, there are 66 in the Conclave at this Election; the three who are abſent, are, Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> the Cardinals <hi>Sandova</hi> and <hi>Borgia</hi> in <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here arived divers Gentlemen with ſtore of money from <hi>Naples,</hi> to the Ambaſſador of <hi>Spain,</hi> for the private bribing of divers Cardinals, and to gain as many of them as they can, to be Creatures to that Crown, and ſerve the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> intereſt. In the mean time, to operate the more effectually upon the ſacred Colledg of Cardinals, the Vice-Roy of <hi>Naples</hi> encroacheth day after day upon the Papal Dominions, for the frighting of ſome, and gaining others. Divers ſubtile inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating Papers have been ſpred likewiſe, to ſet forth how convenient it is, to make choice of no man for Pope, but ſuch a one as may be able and active in officiating the Papal Function; which reflects a little too much upon the eldeſt Cardinals.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, the <hi>French</hi> make a buſtle, and that party make it their buſineſs to keep Cardinal <hi>De Medici</hi> from the Popedom; the Sieur <hi>De Lyonne,</hi> Ambaſſador of <hi>France,</hi> is ſaid to have received one hundred thouſand Piſtols, to try practiſes upon the Conclave; and in caſe there be occaſion of purchaſing the voice of any one poor Cardinal, then to cooperate with the <hi>St. Eſprit</hi> (as the <hi>French</hi> phraſe ſpeaks) for the creating of ſuch a Pope, as will conſider the intereſt of the Church, and of <hi>France,</hi> and the ſalvation of Souls, rather then the intereſt of <hi>Spain.</hi> It is conceived, the Cardinals will hardly agree about the Election of a Pope before <hi>Eaſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The late Pope, a little before his death, took a Ring off his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, of very great value, which he delivered to the Sieur <hi>Scotty-Major,</hi> to be by him preſented to the ſucceeding Pope; which the Lady <hi>Olympia</hi> deſiring to view, he refuſed her. The common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this City, and others, are very much offended, that this Lady, and the Prince <hi>Pamphillo</hi> her ſon, and the reſt of the Popes Kinred, ſhewed ſo little of charity, and honor, at his funeral, that they did not provide for him two Cheſts, one of Lead, and another of Cypreſs-wood, according to the uſual manner of Popes, inſomuch that for want thereof, his body was left in the lower Hall, in a naſty pickle, to the mercy of Rats and Mice, which gnawed part of his Noſe and Face, through the negligence and drowſineſs of thoſe that watched it; which verifies the Propheſie delivered ſome time ſince by an Aſtrologer concerning this laſt Pope, <hi>Carebit propriâ Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulturâ, He ſhall want a convenient Burial.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="5147" facs="tcp:168799:4"/>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding all diligence hath been uſed, in enquiring after the Authors of thoſe bitter Paſquils, which proclaim moſt horrid things touching the deceaſed Pope, and moſt ſevere puniſhments are threatned againſt them, yet they proceed in revilings every day; ſo that Father <hi>Oliva,</hi> a Jeſuit his Ghoſtly Father, to vindicate him, hath put forth a brief Relation of all that paſſed at the death of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, aſſuring the world, that before he died, he gave very eminent Teſtimonies of his Piety, and manifeſted an entire reſignation to the Will of God, and a very great willingneſs to part with the world.</p>
                  <p>The advancement to the Popedom, lies between three Cardinals, by name <hi>Sachetti, Caraffa,</hi> and <hi>Bragadino.</hi>

                  <p>Diſcovery being made where divers written Papers of dangerous conſequence were kept cloſe, and alſo of divers Printed treaſonous Papers, contrived on purpoſe, to promote deſigns of Inſurrection; they were all ſeized by ſome Meſſengers of the Council, who at the ſame time, with the Papers, found a new Buff Coat, and a rich great Saddle, which they brought away with them. The ſame day, his Highneſs ſent notice to Maj. Gen. <hi>Harriſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Carew,</hi> Col. <hi>Rich,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Courtney,</hi> to come and appear before him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Feb.</hi> 15. The aforeſaid perſons neglecting to appear, they were this morning fetched in by Meſſengers, and about four a clock afternoon, they were admitted into his Highneſſes preſence, where ſome pains was taken to convince them of their diſcontents and diſaffection to the Government; but in vain, for they appeared ſtiff in opinion, juſtifying themſelves, and refuſing to give aſſurance of their peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able behavior under the Government. Whereupon, a Council be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called, and the matter taken into conſideration they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the cuſtody of the Serjeant at Arms attending the Council, in whoſe hands they remain till farther order.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>London, Feb.</hi> 15. Order was taken in the City, for the raiſing of the ſix moneths Aſſeſſment, according to the order and declaration of his Highneſs and the Council, and warrants were iſſued out for the ſpeedy collecting and paying it in to the Treaſurers. The like is done for collecting it, by the Juſtices of the County of <hi>Middleſex.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Feb.</hi> 16. The perſons nominated by his Highneſs to be a Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of <hi>Militia</hi> in the City of <hi>London,</hi> met together; and having read their Commiſſion, immediately proceeded upon it, and made ſome progreſs in the buſineſs of raiſing forces, for ſecurity of the City, and defence of his Highneſs, and the Commonwealth in this time of danger.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Feb.</hi> 17. There was a meeting of the Lord Major, Aldermen, and Common Council, at <hi>Guildhil,</hi> to conſider of the ſame Affair, which was entertained with great conſent and alacrity, the City being very ſenſible of their own danger at this ſeaſon, and of the care of his Highneſs touching their welfare, and the confidence he hath been pleaſed to repoſe in them: In conſideration whereof, it was ordered
<pb facs="tcp:168799:5"/> by unanimous conſent of Common Council, that a Committee of their own, ſhould preſent themſelves at <hi>Whitehal</hi> on Monday, and give his Highneſs humble and hearty thanks, in the name of the City.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whitehal, Feb.</hi> 19. The Committee from the City had audience of his Highneſs, to whom they at large delivered the ſence of the Common Council, letting him underſtand how ready they are to uſe all good ways and means, for the putting of his Highneſſes Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, in ſpeedy execution: Adding moreover, that they ſo far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the great pains and care of his Highneſs to preſerve the Publick Peace, and in particular, his favorable reſpects toward the City, that they ſhall not onely with all cheerfulneſs obſerve his commands in the matter of the <hi>Militia,</hi> propounded to them, but do ſomewhat alſo of their own accord, in order to the ſervice of his Highneſs and the Commonwealth, which may give a Teſtimony of their hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and hearty thanks. The obſervation of this cordial-correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence between his Highneſs, and the honorable City of <hi>London;</hi> as it is a matter of good example to other Parts of the Nation, upon the ſame grounds of prudence to minde the common ſafety, ſo it muſt needs be a diſheartning and terror to all publick Enemies and Deſigners.</p>
                  <p>Progreſs is made ſtill in diſcovery of the late conſpiracy; of which more by the next.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Dalkeith, Feb.</hi> 13. The Commiſſioners who came from <hi>Middleton,</hi> are now gone back without any agreement, when it was thought all had been accorded. There is no danger of what they can be able to do; ſome of thoſe Gentlemens ſervants who were here, reported among the Soldiers in this Town, That their Maſters were returning to places ſo poor, and deſtitute of all accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they would leave them before they ſhould get to the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands.</p>
